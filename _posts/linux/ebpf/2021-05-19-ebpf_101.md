eBPF can be programmed using one of many frontends available, e.g., LLVM, BCC and bpftrace,
from lowest- to highest-level languages.

The LLVM compiler supports BPF as the target and higher-level languages, like C can be compiled
into BPF. BCC and bpftrace internally using LLVM to compile C or its own higher-level language
into BFP.

Viewing BPF instructions
------------------------

`bpftool(8)` is a command-line tool that included in the Linux kernel for viewing and manipulating
the BPF objects.

+ `bpftool perf`: lists BPF programs that been attached to `perf_event_open()`.
+ `bpftool prog show`: lists all BPF programs.
+ `bpftool prog dump xlated`: dumps BPF program instructions in BPF assembly format.
+ `bpftool prog dump jited`: dumps BPF program instructions in machine code format.
+ ......

The `bpftrace` can also be used to viewing the BPF program with the `-v` command-line option:

```
bpftrace -v biolatency.bt
```
